## AI-Powered Code Suggestions and Autocompletion

Warstellar analyzes your codebase to provide precise code suggestions. As you type, it predicts completions, generates functions, and even refactors code on the fly. Accept suggestions with Tab or customize them via inline edits.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="JavaScript" icon="code">
    Start typing a React component, and Warstellar completes it:

````javascript
function UserProfile({ user }) {
  return (
    <div className="profile">
      <h1>{`user.name`}</h1>  // AI suggests: user.name
      <p>{`user.email`}</p>   // AI autocompletes full prop access
    </div>
  );
}
````

    Press Tab to accept, or use Ctrl+Enter for multi-line generation.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Python" icon="code">
    In a data script, get function completions:

````python
import pandas as pd

def analyze_data(df):
    summary = df.`describe`()  # AI suggests: describe()
    return summary
````
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

<Callout kind="tip">
  Enable "Inline Suggestions" in settings for non-intrusive completions.
</Callout>

## Integrated Debugging and Error Resolution

Catch bugs before they slow you down. Warstellar highlights issues, suggests fixes, and runs diagnostics automatically. You hover over errors for one-click resolutions.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Detect Error" icon="alert-triangle">
    Write code with a potential issue. Warstellar underlines it immediately.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Apply Fix" icon="zap">
    Hover and select "Fix with AI". Review the diff before applying.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Test Inline" icon="play">
    Run tests directly in the editor to verify the resolution.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<CodeGroup tabs="JavaScript,Python">
```javascript
// Before: Error-prone loop
for (let i = 0; i < users.length; i++) {  // Warstellar flags off-by-one
  console.log(users[i + 1]);  // AI suggests: i
}

// After AI fix:
users.forEach(user => console.log(user));
```

```python
# Before: Index error
for i in range(len(data)):
    print(data[i + 1])  # Warstellar suggests bounds check

# After AI fix:
for item in data:
    print(item)
```
</CodeGroup>

## Human-AI Collaboration Workflows

Seamlessly blend your input with AI assistance. Start a task, let Warstellar propose solutions, then iterate together. Share sessions with teammates for live co-editing.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    You->>Warstellar: Describe task: "Build login form"
    Warstellar->>You: Generate initial code
    You->>Warstellar: Refine: "Add validation"
    Warstellar->>You: Update with fixes
    Note over You,Teammate: Share session
    Teammate->>Warstellar: Edit collaboratively
```

<Callout kind="info">
  Use `@ai` commands in comments to trigger specific AI actions, like `@ai refactor this function`.
</Callout>

## Customization Options

Tailor Warstellar to your workflow. Adjust AI models, themes, keybindings, and extensions.
